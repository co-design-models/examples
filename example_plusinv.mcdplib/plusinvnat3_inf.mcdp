# This is an example of an infeasible problem. 
# 
# The problem can be rewritten as:
#    minimize (x,y)
#    s.t.  x + y >= x + y + z
#  with z a parameter. 
# The solution is: 
#    z = 0   ->  {(0,0)}
#    z > 0   ->  Ã¸
#  Trying to solve this problem with the standard MCDP solver 
#  will create a (practically) infinite loop as the program 
#  tries to explore most of the antichains of N^2.
